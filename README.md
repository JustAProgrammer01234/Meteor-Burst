# Meteor-Burst
A game made with pygame.

# Disclaimer
1.If your wondering why the sound files aren't in my repository, it's because Github is complaining that the file is too big. :(

2.Unfortunately I deleted the IMGS directory because the pictures aren't mine.

#What the game is all about
It is a game that is similar to a task in among us where you have to shoot the meteors.
